# Output Directory

Make sure that your program outputs the results in the `output` directory.

# Output Files

This folder is used to store the output files generated by the log extraction script.

## File Naming Convention

- Output files are named using the format:  
  `output_YYYY-MM-DD.txt`
- `YYYY-MM-DD` corresponds to the date for which logs were extracted.

## How to Use

- After running the extraction script, check this folder for the file matching the queried date.
- Each file contains all log entries from the original log file that match the specified date.
